# Possible Projects of Interest

I would like to work on a project relating to well-being & mindfulness.
During lab 1, I found a project that related to LaTeX that I thought was interesting.

# Organization

As of now, I think a common repository while working on different branches would be best.
This is because I have worked on projects in the past where this is the structure so I am more familiar with it.
However, I would not be opposed to other formats.
